## Brand & Style

The design system is engineered for high-stakes corporate environments where clarity, authority, and efficiency are paramount. The brand personality is "Institutional Modernism"—combining the stability of traditional corporate identities with the fluid, data-driven interfaces of modern SaaS.

The aesthetic leans into **Minimalism** with a **Corporate Modern** execution. It prioritizes high-quality typography and strategic whitespace to reduce cognitive load for executive decision-makers. Visual interest is generated through precise geometry and a "Content-First" hierarchy, ensuring that data visualization and key performance indicators remain the focal point of every view.

## Colors

This design system utilizes five distinct color themes to cater to different corporate sub-brands or functional modules. Each palette is anchored by a high-contrast Primary color used for navigation and brand presence, and a Secondary color for interactive elements and accents.

- **Surface Tones:** Backgrounds utilize very light desaturated tints of the primary hue (98-95% lightness) to maintain brand cohesion without sacrificing readability.
- **Contrast:** A strict adherence to WCAG AAA standards (7:1) for all body text is required.
- **Functional Colors:** Success (Emerald), Warning (Amber), and Error (Crimson) should be desaturated to align with the professional tone of the primary palettes.

## Typography

**Inter** is the sole typeface for this design system to ensure maximum legibility across high-density data grids and complex dashboards.

- **Weight Strategy:** Use `SemiBold` (600) for section headings to provide a strong visual anchor. Use `Medium` (500) for UI labels to differentiate them from static body text.
- **Letter Spacing:** Headlines utilize negative tracking (-1% to -2%) to appear tighter and more "editorial," while small labels use positive tracking (+5%) to maintain legibility at small scales.
- **Scaling:** On mobile devices, Display and Headline sizes scale down by approximately 25% to avoid excessive line-wrapping in narrow viewports.

## Layout & Spacing

The design system follows a **Fixed-Fluid Hybrid Grid**. The content is housed within a 1440px max-width container, centered on the screen.

- **Grid:** A 12-column system is used for desktop, 8-column for tablet, and 4-column for mobile.
- **Rhythm:** An 8px linear scale governs all spatial relationships.
- **Density:** Executive interfaces should default to a "Comfortable" density (16px/24px padding), but data-heavy modules (like financial tables) may switch to a "Compact" density (8px/12px) to maximize information per screen.
- **Reflow:** On mobile, sidebars collapse into bottom-navigation bars or "hamburger" menus, and multi-column forms reflow into a single vertical stack.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is conveyed through **Tonal Layers** rather than heavy shadows. This maintains the clean, "flat-modern" aesthetic favored in corporate software.

- **Level 0 (Base):** The primary background color.
- **Level 1 (Cards/Surface):** White or slightly off-white surfaces with a 1px border (#E0E0E0).
- **Level 2 (Interaction):** A subtle, ultra-diffused shadow (Y: 4, Blur: 12, Opacity: 0.05) is applied only when an element is hovered or active.
- **Outlines:** Use "Ghost Borders"—low-contrast (10-15% opacity) strokes—to define structure without creating visual noise.

## Shapes

The shape language is **Soft (0.25rem)**. This provides a professional, "tailored" appearance that feels modern without being overly casual or "bubbly."

- **Buttons:** 4px (0.25rem) corner radius.
- **Cards/Modals:** 8px (0.5rem) corner radius for larger containers.
- **Form Inputs:** 4px (0.25rem) to match buttons, creating a unified horizontal line across forms.

## Components

- **Buttons:** Primary buttons use the palette's `Primary` color with white text. Secondary buttons use a "Ghost" style (Primary color border and text).
- **Cards:** Used for grouping related data. Cards should have a 1px solid border with no shadow in their default state.
- **Input Fields:** Use a floating label or top-aligned label. The "Active" state is indicated by a 2px bottom border or a full-border tint in the `Secondary` color.
- **Data Tables:** Highly structured with `body-md` typography. Use zebra-striping (tinted at 2% opacity) for row readability.
- **Chips:** Used for status indicators (e.g., "Pending," "Approved"). These use a desaturated background of the status color with high-contrast text.
- **Navigation:** A persistent left-hand sidebar for desktop, utilizing the `Primary` color at 100% saturation for the background to anchor the application.
